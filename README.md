## Questions we need to answer {?}
1. Tabs
   - Not sure what these are meant to do. They could be ways of interacting with the 'deal'.
     - Buyback = Customer wants their item back
     - Renew = Start 'deal' again
     - Clone = Copy it (for some reason)
     - Seize = Close 'deal' taking ownership of the stock
2. Passcode
   - It was specified that this is required for Buy In only. Maybe that was an error.
   - Suspect it is for mobile phone, laptop, etc. passcodes.
3. Operator
   - I assume this is to track who logs various stock, sales, etc.
   - Expect a dropdown will suffice for this. Staff probably dont want to sign in and out for each sale/process.
