## Questions we need to answer {?}
1. Tabs
   - Not sure what these are meant to do. They could be ways of interacting with the 'deal'.
     - Buyback = Customer wants their item back
     - Renew = Start 'deal' again
     - Clone = Copy it (for some reason)
     - Seize = Close 'deal' taking ownership of the stock
2. Passcode
   - It was specified that this is required for Buy In only. Maybe that was an error.
   - Suspect it is for mobile phone, laptop, etc. passcodes.
   - Adding to stock table
3. Operator
   - I assume this is to track who logs various stock, sales, etc.
   - Plan to use the User table, they will be required to sign in/out as required.
     - Can make this a simpler process
       - Dropdown quick select of user
       - Prompt for password
4. Search
   - build something
   - search: "laravel search"
5. Pay cash
   - email Emma face for clarification
   - could be wetehr they paid cash or cash price for selling it
